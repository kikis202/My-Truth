# Twitter clone - My truth

My first experience using `t3-app` following Theo's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkOSUVzOAA4&t=1319s)

App uses:

- Vercel for deployment
- Prisma database
- PlanetScale for DB deployment
- Clerk for user management
- Upstash for rate limiting
- Axiom for logs
